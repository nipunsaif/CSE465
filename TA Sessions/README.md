# CSE465: PyTorch Coding Tutorial

Welcome to the **CSE465: PyTorch Coding Tutorial** repository! This project is designed to provide an easy-to-follow introduction to neural networks and deep learning concepts using PyTorch. You'll find resources, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks to help you understand and apply basic deep learning techniques.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
  
- **`Session1_ANN.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook covering:
  - Data Loading (Tabular dataset)
  - Data Pre-processing
  - Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using PyTorch
  - ANN Training and Evaluation
  
**Note: The dataset link is provided at the beginning of the notebook.**

- **`Session2_CNN.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook covering:
  - Data Loading (Image dataset)
  - Image Data Pre-processing
  - Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch
  - CNN Training and Evaluation
  - Live demonstration for CNN: https://deeplizard.com/resource/pavq7noze2

üöÄ **The notebooks were executed on Google Colab using a T4 GPU.**
